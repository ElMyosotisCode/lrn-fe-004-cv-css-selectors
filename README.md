# Misael's F. End Learning Day-04 - "CV ATS Web Page part-04"

Hello... 😃👋🏻

## Learning Module Session 4 -> CSS Selectors

Here are some key points I learned in this project:
- Starting to understand about `specificity` in CSS, which helps in determining which styles are applied when multiple rules match the same element.
- Learn about `LVHA` concept (Layout, Visual, Hover, Active) to organize CSS Animations rules effectively.
- How to implement `CSS hover effects` to enhance user interaction on my web page.
- How to use external CSS libraries to quickly add complex animations without writing extensive custom code.
- How to grouping CSS rules to apply same rules uniformity to multiple elements, making my code cleaner and more efficient.
