# Misael's F. End Learning Day-04 - "CV ATS Web Page part-04"

Hello... üòÉüëãüèª  
It's me Misael Randy Limpaty (ElMyosotisCode) your future Front End Developer Expert.

This project is the continuation of "ATS Based CV".

In this progress session, I added some CSS Hover animation, such as: ‚úå
- CSS Hover Animation for Navigation Menu
- CSS Hover Animation for External Web Links

* Credits to IanLunn for the CSS Hover Animation

Here are some key points I learned in this project:
- Starting to understand about **_specificity_** in CSS, which helps in determining which styles are applied when multiple rules match the same element.
- Learn about **_LVHA_** concept (Layout, Visual, Hover, Active) to organize CSS Animations rules effectively.
- How to implement **_CSS hover effects_** to enhance user interaction on my web page.
- How to use external CSS libraries to quickly add complex animations without writing extensive custom code.
- How to grouping CSS rules to apply same rules uniformity to multiple elements, making my code cleaner and more efficient.
